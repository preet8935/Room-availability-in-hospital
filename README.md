# Room-availability-in-hospital
This is a smart contract to keep track of the rooms occupied in a hospital. It takes room name,bool variable occupied which state whether the room is filled or not..and 3rd one is occupant name who is occupying a specific room.

Then it takes input as room name and checks the bool variabld occupied whether its true or false, if its true then it returns that room is occupied.
If its false then the constructor add occupant in that room.
